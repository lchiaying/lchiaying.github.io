	<li> <font color='red'>Sep 17:</font> Friday quiz at beginning of lecture period. It will consist of one question on
	continuity of composite functions, and one question on Intermediate Value Theorem. Practice the problems at the end of 
	Chapter 2.6, especially the suggested practice problems.
	<br/>
	Assignment 2 will be distributed on Friday.
	<br/>
	In Friday's lecture, we will continue with introducing derivatives and working with derivatives (Ch 3.1, 3.2). 
	Make sure to read those chapters ahead of Friday's lecture.
